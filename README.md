# HiVaGe

**HiVaGe** - designing a framework to assess the performance of various tools in detecting highly variable genes (HVGs) in diverse datasets of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data in R .

The repository contains the following:

- **"EEBG" folder:** Benchmarking of 5 tools for HVGs on the Mair dataset.

- **"Evaluation" folder:** Code that was used in and plots that were generated while writing an article "Scrutinised and Compared: HVG Identification Methods in Terms of Common Metrics", where there was evaluated 22 methods for HVG identification on 5 diverse datasets.

READMEs for all directories are available.
